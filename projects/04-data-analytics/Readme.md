## Customer Segmentation & Business Case (Restaurant Data)

### Objective
Analyze customer behavior to identify high-value customer segments and translate insights into actionable business recommendations.

### Dataset
- Restaurant tips dataset
- Key variables: total_bill, tip, day, time, size

### Analysis Steps
- Exploratory analysis and value counts
- Customer segmentation based on spending and tipping behavior
- Identification of "Most Valuable Customers"
- Comparative analysis versus other customers

### Key Findings
- Customers with above-average bills and tips represent a smaller segment of orders
- This segment generates disproportionately higher revenue and tipping value per order
- High-value customers are more common during high-revenue periods (e.g. dinner and weekends)

### Business Recommendation
Focus on retaining and attracting high-value customers through targeted offers, loyalty incentives, and optimized service during peak revenue periods.

### Tools
Python, pandas, Jupyter Notebook

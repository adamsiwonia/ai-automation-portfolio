# Restaurant Data Analysis – Business Insights Project

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of restaurant transaction data.
The goal was to extract actionable business insights related to revenue, customer behavior,
and operational optimization.

The analysis focuses on understanding spending patterns, tipping behavior,
time-based performance, and customer segmentation, culminating in an executive-level summary
with business recommendations.

## Dataset Scope
The dataset contains restaurant transaction records with the following key variables:
- Total bill amount
- Tip amount
- Day of the week
- Time of day
- Customer attributes

The analysis covers the full available dataset without sampling.

## Analysis Structure
The project is organized into a sequence of Jupyter notebooks, each building on the previous one:

1. **01_pandas_intro** – Initial data loading and basic exploration  
2. **02_data_cleaning** – Data cleaning and preparation  
3. **03_exploratory_analysis** – Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. **04_groupby_analysis** – Aggregations using groupby operations  
5. **05_pivot_tables** – Pivot table analysis for multi-dimensional insights  
6. **06_advanced_aggregations** – Advanced aggregations and comparisons  
7. **07_customer_segmentation_and_business_case** – Customer segmentation and business framing  
8. **08_visualization** – Key visualizations supporting insights  
9. **09_visualization_insights** – Interpretation of visual findings  
10. **10_executive_summary** – High-level business conclusions and recommendations

## Key Insights
- Weekend and evening periods generate the highest revenue and tipping values.
- High-spend customers represent a smaller share of transactions but contribute
  disproportionately to total revenue.
- Tip behavior correlates more strongly with bill size than with day of the week.
- Transaction volume alone is not a reliable indicator of profitability.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Focus revenue optimization efforts on weekend and evening service periods.
- Prioritize retention and premium offerings for high-spend customer segments.
- Align staffing and operational planning with profitability peaks rather than
  transaction counts alone.

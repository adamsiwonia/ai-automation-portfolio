# AI Support Agent – FastAPI Backend (Project 03)

## Overview

This project implements a production-oriented AI-powered customer support backend built with:

- FastAPI  
- OpenAI API  
- SQLite  
- Structured JSON response validation  
- Persistent request and model-response logging  

The system classifies incoming customer emails, generates structured replies, and stores all interactions for monitoring, debugging, and future analytics.

The focus of this project is backend architecture, reliability, and observability rather than UI.

## Architectural Principles

- Clear separation of concerns (routing / service / persistence)
- Strict data contracts via Pydantic
- Defensive handling of LLM output
- Logging-first design
- Environment-based configuration
- Observability by default

---

## Request Processing Flow

1. Request validated via Pydantic schema  
2. LLM service invoked  
3. Raw model output parsed and validated  
4. Fallback triggered if parsing fails  
5. Request logged to SQLite  
6. Response returned with `request_id` and metrics  

---

## Features

### Intent Classification

Supported categories:

- RETURN  
- REFUND  
- SHIPPING  
- PRODUCT_QUESTION  
- OTHER  

> Note: Category values are model-generated and may not be strictly enforced as enums depending on prompt configuration.

---

### Structured JSON Output

All model responses are parsed and validated against a fixed schema:

```json
{
  "category": "Refund Request",
  "reply": "Customer-facing response text",
  "next_step": "Operational follow-up action"
}
```

If parsing fails:

- The request is still logged  
- `parse_ok` is set to `0`  
- A fallback response is generated  
- The API returns HTTP `502`  

---

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

```
GET /health
```

---

### Generate AI Response

```
POST /generate
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "email": "Customer email text"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "result": {
    "category": "...",
    "reply": "...",
    "next_step": "..."
  },
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 65,
    "output_tokens": 64,
    "total_tokens": 129
  },
  "latency_ms": 2191
}
```

Includes:

- Token usage tracking  
- Latency measurement  
- Request ID for traceability  

---

### Retrieve Logs

```
GET /logs?limit=20
GET /logs?parse_ok=0
GET /logs?category=Refund%20Request
```

Allows inspection of:

- Successful responses  
- Failed parses  
- Error messages  
- Raw model outputs  

---

## Logging & Observability

All requests are stored in SQLite with:

- `request_id`  
- `created_at`  
- `category`  
- `reply`  
- `parse_ok`  
- `error_message`  
- `raw_model_output`  

This enables:

- Debugging malformed LLM responses  
- Monitoring error rates  
- Auditing model behavior  
- Building analytics dashboards  

The system is designed with observability in mind from the start.

---

## Why This Matters

In production AI systems, model outputs are not guaranteed to follow strict schemas.

This project demonstrates how to:

- Enforce structured output validation  
- Handle malformed responses defensively  
- Log all interactions for traceability  
- Measure latency and token usage  
- Build observability into AI systems from day one  

---

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai python-dotenv
```

### 2. Create `.env`

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Start the server

From the project directory:

```
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 4. Interactive API docs

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Design Decisions

- JSON schema validation before returning model output  
- Defensive fallback logic for malformed responses  
- Logging occurs even if generation fails  
- Clear separation between LLM integration and HTTP layer  
- SQLite chosen for lightweight persistence in MVP phase  
- Latency and token usage exposed for monitoring  

---

## Roadmap

- API key authentication  
- Rate limiting  
- Retry logic for malformed JSON responses  
- Conversation history support  
- Docker containerization  
- Cloud deployment  
- Metrics endpoint (`/stats`)  

---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- LLM integration in backend systems  
- Production-style API architecture  
- Structured output enforcement  
- Error handling and resilience strategies  
- Persistent logging for AI systems  
- Observability-first backend thinking  

The system is designed to be extended into a multi-tenant, rate-limited production service.

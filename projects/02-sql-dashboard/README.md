## Overview

This project is a **SQL-based analytical backend** built on the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist.

The goal of the project is to transform raw CSV files into a **clean, analytics-ready PostgreSQL database**, and to build a **semantic layer (SQL views)** that supports business KPIs such as revenue, number of orders, and average order value (AOV).

The project focuses on **real-world data work**, including:
- importing large CSV datasets into PostgreSQL
- handling foreign keys and data integrity
- resolving encoding issues on Windows
- dealing with duplicate primary keys in production data
- building reusable SQL views for analytics and dashboards
